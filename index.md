# What is MTradumàtica?
MTradumàtica is a free, Moses-based web platform for training and using statistical machine translation systems with a user-friendly graphical interface. Its goal is to offer translators a free tool to customise their own SMT engines and enhance their productivity

# What can I do with MTradumàtica?
With MTradumàtica you can train statistical machine translation systems step-by-step and understand how modules interact together to deliver machine translation:

- (1) Upload files from  parallel, sentence-by-line text files such as Moses or TMX format.
- (2) Create and manage monotexts
- (3) Build language models (LMs)
- (4) Create and manage bitexts
- (5) Train SMT translation models using your bitexts and language models. 

Then, you will be able to (6) Translate short texts and documents using these engines, join together machine translation systems, inspect language and translation models and much more.
