# What is MTradumàtica?
MTradumàtica is a free, Moses-based web platform for training and using statistical machine translation systems with a user-friendly graphical interface. Its goal is to offer translators a free tool to customise their own SMT engines and enhance their productivity

# What can I do with MTradumàtica?
With MTradumàtica you can train statistical machine translation systems step-by-step and understand how they interact together to deliver machine translation in a few steps:

- (1) Upload files from  parallel, sentence-by-line text files such as Moses or TMX format.
- (2) Create and manage monotexts
- (3) Build language models (LMs)
- (4) Create and manage bitexts
- (5) Train SMT translation models using your bitexts and language models. 

Then, you will be able to (6) Translate short texts and documents using these engines, join together machine translation systems, inspect language and translation models and much more.

# Who is delivering MTradumàtica?
MTradumàtica is the result of the ProjectTA research project (grant number FFI2013-46041-R (MINECO / FEDER, UE)).

Researchers of the [Tradumatica research group](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/tradumatica/en), within the Translation and Interpreting Department of the Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona, have been working in this project since 2015. Tradumatica research group works in the fields translation technologies, terminology and documentation as well as translation evaluation.

MTradumàtica is developed by [Prompsit Language Engineering](http://www.prompsit.com/home), a company created from the Transducens research group at the University of Alacant that offers custom MT and related services since 2006.
